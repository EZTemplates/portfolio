                        Throughout my career, I have worked on dynamic projects, from creating real-time gaming platforms to developing robust back-end systems. I designed a website for PUBG players that facilitates matchmaking, real-time chat, and profile ranking using technologies like Socket.io, Express.js, and AWS Lightsail. As a full-stack developer, I am constantly exploring emerging technologies, such as Web3 and Blockchain, and seeking opportunities to grow and innovate.
