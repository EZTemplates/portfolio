                    Hi,
                    I am Gaurav Singh, a passionate and dedicated full-stack developer with over 3-4 years of experience in building innovative and user-friendly applications. My expertise spans across a wide range of technologies, including Node.js, React.js, Flutter, Native iOS, MongoDB, MySQL, Docker, Nginx, Linux, AWS EC2, Lightsail, S3, and Redis.

                    Throughout my career, I have worked on dynamic projects, from creating real-time gaming platforms to developing robust back-end systems. I designed a website for PUBG players that facilitates matchmaking, real-time chat, and profile ranking using technologies like Socket.io, Express.js, and AWS Lightsail. As a full-stack developer, I am constantly exploring emerging technologies, such as Web3 and Blockchain, and seeking opportunities to grow and innovate.

                    Beyond my technical skills, I take pride in my problem-solving mindset, adaptability, and ability to work seamlessly within cross-functional teams. As the sole earner for my family, I understand the importance of resilience and dedication, both in my personal life and professional endeavors. I am always eager to learn and contribute, aiming to make a meaningful impact through technology.
